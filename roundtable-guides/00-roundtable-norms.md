# Round Table Norms

At Ada, we call guided reviews and discussion of lessons Round Tables. Round tables provide an opportunity to review concepts, ask questions, share code, and build community.

For today's discussion you are enouraged to do the following:
* Whenever possible, follow Ada Online Communication Norms, modified for this environment:
    * Have your video camera on as much as possible. This allows for attentive engagement, body language, and shared sense of belonging
    * Update your Zoom name so that it conforms to this template and includes your pronouns: First name Last name/Last initial  (pronouns). For example:         Simon Says (they/them), Becca G (she/they), Ada Way (ze/hir), Ada W (ask me), Ada W (use my name)
    * Use the Chat feature or use your voice for conversation and questions.
      * Raise hand in video or use Zoom Reactions to select Raise Hand 
    * Pose questions to the group, not the instructor. It’s a good practice to build comfort with asking questions amongst peers. 
    * Say something or anything, even if you think you might be wrong! Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try. The instructor is available to           correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
    * When discussing code, use screen sharing through Zoom. It’s natural to feel nervous when showing your code, but we will work through it together to         make it comfortable.
