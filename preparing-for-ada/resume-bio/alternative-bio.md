********************
Hello! My name is Ada (she/her) and I'm a current software development student at Ada Developer's Academy in Seattle, WA. Before delving into coding I was a mathematics student at the University of Washington and a sales associate at Macys. While I loved the challenge of what I learned in undergrad and enjoyed making customers happy at Macys, when I discovered programming I realized I could do both - I could be constantly challenged while still directly and immediately impacting peoples' lives. I am detail-oriented and analytical from my math background, and from my retail experience I have gained immense empathy for the people around me and stellar communication skills! I'm looking forward to putting all of these skills together. 

I am extremely excited to begin an internship as a software developer. I cannot wait to exercise all the skills I've gained at Ada as well as learn new skills that will take me to a full-time position. During and after my internship, I  hope to continue learning and to support other women and gender-diverse people in tech.
