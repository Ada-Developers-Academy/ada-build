# Reflection

_Take some time to reflect on the readings. This reflection can take on whatever form works best for you, you might want to have conversations with people about what you read, spend some time free form writing, create a video sharing what you learned or maybe produce a piece of art. It is totally up to you and what works best for you._

## Reflection questions
> We are including a few reflection questions which you can use as a guide if you are having trouble getting started. You can address all of our prompts, choose only a few, or come up with your own.

* What, if anything, was new to you here? What additional questions does this raise for you?

In all honesty? This feels the same as when I read people's discription of their autism. Like I'm finally being shown the language, the secret code, that can allow me to convey/translate my own feelings and experiences into a format that people without those experiences can understand.

Even here, I'm hesitant to bring up autism/asperger's. I'm scared that the prejudgement of my capabilites makes this a mistake. But to be honest to myself, and to truly be myself, I need to stop hiding from what others _might_ think about me. It is a part of my experience, and part of me. Just a label, but labels can be descriptive and helpful. They don't have to be limiting...


* After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?

people from poor backgrounds. people of color. people with disabilities (who are more likely to be poor/come from a disadvantaged background). neurodiversity.

we all belong at the table. not just to be a checkmark. not just to sit quietly and learn from our "betters." we all deserve equal spots and equal voices. it's only when all our voices are heard that tech, healthcare, government, and everything else will actually _work for_ **everyone**.


* Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?

how can i practice "micro resistance?"

I think for me, looking at it not as "micro" is better. remembering that although I may feel strong enough in that moment to not let it sting ... someone else might not. That is why it is my obligation to speak up.

Remembering that the people perpetrating those acts are acting out of ignorance. recognizing that ignorance as a _teachable moment_ and having the prescence of mind to calmly (or not so calmly) correct wrong assumptions and false beliefs.
