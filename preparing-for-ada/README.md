# Ada Developers Academy JumpStart Curriculum

## The Ada Application Process

You can read more about the Ada application process [on our website](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/process/).  With the online application you will submit a resume and answer some questions.  

If you proceed to Phase 2, you will be confronted with a coding challenge in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to solve and an interview to explain your solution and examine ways to extend it.  

If you proceed to Phase 3 you will participate in a video interview which will focus on behavioral questions to gauge your passion for Ada's mission and software development, aptitude for learning in our collaborative and inclusive environment, grit and determination to succeed.
