# Round Table Norms

At Ada, we call guided reviews and discussion of lessons Round Tables. Round tables provide an opportunity to review concepts, ask questions, share code, and build community.

For today's discussion you are enouraged to do the following:
* Whenever possible, follow Ada Online Communication Norms, modified for this environment:
    * Have your video camera on as much as possible. This allows for attentive engagement, body language, and shared sense of belonging
    * Update your Zoom name so that it conforms to this template and includes your pronouns: Name (pronouns). For example: Simon (they/them), Becca (she/they), Ada (ze/hir), Ada (ask me), Ada (use my name)
    * Use the Chat feature or use your voice for conversation and questions.
* Pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try. The instructor is available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* When discussing code, use screen sharing through Zoom.
