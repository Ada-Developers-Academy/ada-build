# Conditionals
## Day 2

### Warm up
* Discuss candy machine code
* Discuss code with vocabulary: conditional statements, variable assignment, relational operators, logical operators, expressions

### Discussion
* Recap code quality discussion
* Review conditionals, booleans and truth tables

### Exercise

#### Converting text into conditional statements
In one Ruby file, write code to solve the problems below. Before each item your code should print out the problem statement itself.

1. Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than 70, print PASSING; otherwise, print NOT PASSING.    
1. Prompt for a number. If the number is less than or equal to 50, print GO, otherwise, print STOP.
1. Prompt for an integer. If the number is even, print EVEN, otherwise, print ODD.
1. Prompt for an integer. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print MULTIPLE OF 5, otherwise, print NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5.    
1. Prompt for a number. If the number is less than 10, print ONE DIGIT. If the number is 100 or greater, print THREE DIGITS, otherwise print TWO DIGITS.
1. Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is 12, 71, or 80, print “That number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!”, otherwise do nothing.
1. Prompt for a state. If the state is Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, print “This state is in the PNW”, otherwise print “You should move to the PNW; it’s great here!”
1. Prompt for a one of the following: SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI. Print out the number of ounces that drink includes (8, 12, 16, 20 respectively). 
1. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay. Provide ‘time and a half’ for hours worked beyond 40  (e.g., if you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week, you would gross 40x10 + 5x15 = $745).
1. Reuse the solution from 9. with slight modifications as described. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay if the hours are 40 or less. Provide ‘time and a half’ for hours worked beyond 40. Do not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than 60, instead display the message “Please see manager.” 

### Debrief
* Show two candy machines implemented differently
