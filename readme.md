# Ada Developers Academy Jump Start Curriculum

This repository contains the materials for the Jumpstart program as part of [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/). These materials are free and open to everyone. These materials and concepts will provide an introduction into programming tools, concepts and processes to assist in getting to the first step in your programming journey.

## Introduction to Social Justice
Ada is as much a social justice organization as it is a school where people learn to program. Our core values at Ada are building and contributing to a supportive community, creating and advocating for inclusivity, and teaching and practicing lifelong learning, all within Tech. Having a basic understanding of social justice is crucial to upholding these core values.
