# Environment Setup
## Creating a Gist Directly From Atom
_This lesson is optional. It walks you through how to create a `gist` directly from `Atom`._

### Part 1
1. In `Atom` type `cmd` + `,` (thats the command key, and the comma key); this will open your Atom settings
2. On the left hand-side, click `Install`
3. Type `gist-it` in the search field and press enter
4. Click `install` on the package named `gist-it`
5. When it finishes installing, click `Settings` on the `gist-it` package
6. We recommend checking `New Gists default to private`

### Part 2
1. Go to [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
2. Login to Github
3. Type `gist` in the `Token Description` text box, check the `gist` box, and scroll down and click `Generate token`
4. Copy the generated token

### Part 3
1. Go back to Atom and paste in your token in the `OAuth token` box
2. Open up a file in Atom that you would like to create a gist of and press `cmd` + `option` + `g`, name your gist, and then click `Gist It`
3. You will now have the link to the `gist` you just made in your copy buffer and you can paste it directly into your homework survey

When you want to create another `gist` you do not need a new token, you instead only need to `cmd` + `option` + `g`, name your gist, and then click `Gist It` for any future gists.
