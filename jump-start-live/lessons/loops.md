# Loops
## Day 3

### Warm up
* Discuss election time code
* Discuss code with vocabulary: blocks, loops, iterator, variable assignment, conditional statement

### Discussion
* Recap conditionals
* Review looping constructs
* Counter controlled vs. sentinel controlled loop exercise

### Exercises
#### Guessing game

Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing number game. You should predetermine the secret number (between 0 – 1000). Allow the user to make a guess until they guess the answer. After each incorrect guess you should print a clue “higher” or “lower”.

#### Loves me not

Write a program that allows a user to enter the number of petals on a flower. Then one by one, print “plucking petal #1: they love me!”. Alternate “They love me” and “They love me not” as well as increase the petal number for each petal.

### Debrief:
* Different types of loops used
* Different ways to utilize different loops for the same goal
