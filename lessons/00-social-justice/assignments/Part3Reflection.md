*Brief responses are just fine*

1. Can you think of an example of a microaggression that you have experienced, witnessed, or perpetrated? How did you handle it? Would you handle it the same way now?

1. Knowing what we know about institutional oppression and the lack of diversity in tech, what would you like to see tech organizations and companies doing to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion?
