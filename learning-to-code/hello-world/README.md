# Hello world

_JumpStart: Lesson 8_

## Learning Goal

* Write and execute Ruby code
* Practice using `irb` and running Ruby files from the terminal

## Overview

A _Hello World_ program is the first program that people often write when exploring with a new programming language. In this lesson you will write a hello world program in `irb` and using a Ruby file. `irb` is great for quick exploration, and using a Ruby file is great when you want to have a record of the code that was written so it can be executed again later.

## Activities

* Read about the history of ["hello, world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
* Write and execute a hello world program in the terminal using `irb`

1. Open terminal
2. Type `irb` and press [enter]
3. Type `puts "Hello, World!"` and press [enter]

### Write a hello world program in a Ruby file

1. Open terminal
2. Type `touch hello_world.rb` to create the file
3. Type `code .` to open the file in VS Code
4. Type `puts "Hello, World"` and save the file
5. In terminal type `ruby hello_world.rb` and press [enter]

### Reflect

Reflect on the steps you completed, and try them a few more times without referencing the instructions to practice using `irb` and from researching online, understand the difference between `print` and `puts` methods in Ruby.
