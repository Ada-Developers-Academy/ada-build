# Variable Worksheet

Read the code in each section, then predict the output of the final line of code.

Each problem stands alone. Variables from previous problems do not exist in subsequent exercises..

*Example:*
```ruby
x = 5
y = 6
x + y
# => 11
```

## Problem Set

1.
```ruby
x = 5
x
```
**5**

2.
```ruby
z = "Hello"
z
```
**Hello**

3.
```ruby
x = 5
y = 3.2
x + y
```
**8.2**

4.
```ruby
var1 = "lawl"
var2 = "brb"
var2
```
**brb**

5.
```ruby
x = 6+3
x
```
**9**

6.
```ruby
x = 3.5
x = x + 2
x
```
**5.5**

7.
```ruby
poodle = 4
pitbull = 3
boxer
```
**(nothing)**

8.
```ruby
x = 5
x = x + x
x
```
**10**

9.
```ruby
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
a + b + c
```
**6**

10.
```ruby
a = "moo"
b = "quack"
a  = b
b
```
**quack**

11.
```ruby
a = "moo"
b = "quack"
c = "woof"
a = c
a
```
**woof**

12.
```ruby
x = 5
x = x * 2
x = x * 2
x = x * 2
x
```
**40**

13.
```ruby
a = 5
b = 6
3 * 6
```
**18**

14.
```ruby
a = "b"
b = "a"
a
```
**b**

15.
```ruby
a = 3234
b = 2398
c = 0
(a+b)/c
```
**5632**

16.
```ruby
y = 7
y % 2
 ```
 **1** *I couldn't figure this one out without creating and running (y=7 >puts y%2)*

17.
```ruby
y = 12
y % 4
 ```
 **0**

18.
```ruby
z = 17
z % 3
```
**2**

19.
```ruby
a = 5
b = 6
a < b
```
**true**


20.
```ruby
a = 5
b = 6
b >= a
```
**true**
