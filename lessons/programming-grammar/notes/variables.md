# Notes: Variables

In programming, we often need to retain _values_ that are the result of computations or _commands_. Maybe we want to refer to the _values_ later, or maybe calculating the _value_ was very time consuming or complicated. A _variable_ is a construct which has a name that refers to a specific _value_. _Variables_ are _declared_ by choosing a name and using the `=` command to assign a _value_ to it.

A _variable_ can have any _type_ of _value_ assigned to it. Here are some examples of creating a _variable_:

```ruby
dog_name = "Rosa"
cat_name = "Raquel"
dog_age  = 7
cat_age  = 11

favorite_color = gets.chomp
```
