# Effective Internet Searching
_Jump start: Lesson 3_

## Learning Goals
- To know where to go for answers
- To be able to evaluate a source as likely to have the answer you are looking for (or not)
- To be able to narrow your search results to yield better results
- To find answers to a question on your own

## Overview
Software developers do not have all of the answers, instead a good portion of their time is spent searching the internet and references for the answers. Common tools that developers use include [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google](http://google.com). What's most important is that you can find the answer, not that you know the answer right away.

## Techniques
* Type using keywords instead of full sentences
* Add 'example' to your query if you want to see an example
* Add the specific language you are coding in to your query, e.g. 'ruby'
* Use double quotations when you need an exact match in your search
* Make sure to check the date of what you are referencing, languages often change over time
