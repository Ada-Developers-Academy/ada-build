Reflection
Note: If you have been accepted into Ada you should email your reflection directly to Sarah Ervin, Ada's Student Counselor and Diversity Trainer.

Take some time to reflect on the readings. This reflection can take on whatever form works best for you, you might want to have conversations with people about what you read, spend some time free form writing, create a video sharing what you learned or maybe produce a piece of art. It is totally up to you and what works best for you.

Reflection questions
We are including a few reflection questions which you can use as a guide if you are having trouble getting started. You can address all of our prompts, choose only a few, or come up with your own.

What, if anything, was new to you here? What additional questions does this raise for you?

After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?

Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?
