  ELECTION RESULTS....

  Vote Summary:
  Goofy - 3 vote(s)

  WINNER: Minnie Mouse!
```
## Optional Enhancements
Some of these enhancements are better solved after having knowledge from [lesson 12](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/learning-to-code/arrays), so you can try some and then come back and do others after lesson 12.

- Handle ties for a winner appropriately
- Handle grammar of vote summary saying vote or votes appropriately
- Handle write in votes
- Consider how to handle more than 10 votes
- Consider how to handle more than 3 candidates
- Refactor your code so that your code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
