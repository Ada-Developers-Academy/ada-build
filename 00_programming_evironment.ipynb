Uses for Jupyter Notebook include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

While we don't need to use keyboard shortcuts exclusively yet &mdash; even professional developers will still use the mouse occasionally &mdash; it's a good idea to start getting used to them as soon as possible. The more we use them, the more habitual they become.\n",
