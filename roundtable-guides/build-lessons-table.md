## Introduction to Programming in Python

The following lessons will introduce you to the fundamentals of programming including writing your first program, learning programming vocabulary, and learning to store and interact with data. The first lesson, [Programming Environment](../intro-to-python/environment-setup/), will go over how to access the lessons. The Review Discussion Guides will be used to facilitate discussion at the Saturday review sessions.
