# Assignment: Student Account Generator

We are going to write a program that generates some student information. This exercise will practice our skills with strings, random numbers, arrays and iterators.

## Requirements

1. You will start by creating three arrays:
    - An array that will contain student names
    - An array that will store student ID numbers
    - An array that will contain student email addresses   

    **Note** Make sure to name your variables appropriately so that it is easy to deduce the information stored in each array and that this information is not singular. e.g.  
    `flowers = ["lily", "rose", "gardenia", "daisy"] vs. flower = "tulip"`

2. Write a `times` loop that asks the user to enter in 5 student names (first and last name) and store those values in the first array in **all uppercase** even if the information is not entered by the user in uppercase.  
Example output:
![student names](../images/student-names.png)

3. Write a `times` loop to generate random student ID numbers from 111111 to 999999 and put these values to the student ID number array.  
Example output:
![student IDS](../images/student-ids.png)

4. Write a `times` loop to generate student email addresses in the format:
  (first inital)+(last name)+(last 3 digits of student ID number)@adadevelopersacademy.org  
  Example output:
  ![student emails](../images/student-emails.png)

5. Write the code which will print out all the student names, ID numbers, and email addresses in parallel.


## Optional Enhancements

- make sure none of the IDs are duplicates
- account for ID numbers whose last 3 digits are less than 100 (e.g. 111008) because these ID numbers will generate an email address with less than 3 digits at the end without special cases.
- on email generation, account for first names with a space in them  
  e.g. if the first name is "Mary Jane", then the first initial should be "MJ" rather than just "M"
- read in the student names from a file instead of the user and make the array size according to the number of names
