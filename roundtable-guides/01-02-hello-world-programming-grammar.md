# Lesson 01: Hello, World! and Lesson 02: Programming Grammar

Today's round table will focus on reviewing the first two lessons in Ada Build: [**01 - Hello, World!**](XXX) and [**02 - Programming Grammar**](XXX).

# Hello, World!

1. Describe the following snippet of code using the vocabulary `function`, *argument*, *call*, and *string*.

```python
print('Welcome to Ada Build!')
```

# Programming Grammar

## Comments
1. Describe the purpose of comments. 
    - Who are they useful to and in what ways?
    
## Data Types

1. What is the difference between a `String` and a `Float`.
1. How can we check the data type of a `variable` or a `literal`.
    - Why is it useful to know?

### Mathematical Operations and Precedence

1. How is truncating division `//` different from division `/`. 
    - Describe a real world situation where truncating division `//` is useful?
1. What operation does the modulus operator `%` perform?
    - Describe a real world situation where the modulus operator `%` is useful?
1. Describe the order in which the following operations are performed:
    `-5 + 2 * 3 < 20 + 4 * -5`

## Assignment Statements

1. Let's discuss the difference between an assignment statement `x = 5` and a comparison statement `x == 5`.

1. How can the following snippet of code be rewritten without the compound operator `+=`:
     - `x += 1`

## Strings

1. In python, we use f-strings for string interpolation. What can be put inside of the `{ }` of an f-string?
1. Why is the escape character `\` sometimes necessary? 
    * For instance, why do we need to type `\"` to include double quotes in a string?
1. Describe how to select a single character from a string?
    * How do we select multiple characters?

### Practice Problems

1. What question do you have about the practice problems?
    - Which problems were the most challenging or suprising?

## Extra Extra
