# Reflection

_Take some time to reflect on the readings. This reflection can take on whatever form works best for you, you might want to have conversations with people about what you read, spend some time free form writing, create a video sharing what you learned or maybe produce a piece of art. It is totally up to you and what works best for you._

* After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?



* Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?
