# 00 – Introduction to Social Justice

In this lesson you’ll be asked to read and think about issues of identity, privilege, oppression, and social justice. This may be new to you, or it may be a huge piece of your daily, lived experience. Our readings will focus primarily on race and gender, but should also give you a lens through which to understand a wide breadth of social justice and identity issues. Our goal here is to build some of the linguistic and conceptual skills that will start the work of having safe, productive, community-affirming conversations about systemic inequities.

## Learning Goals
- Build a framework for critical, informed conversations around diversity and inclusion.
- Develop a shared social justice vocabulary.
- Develop an increased understanding of the impact of privilege and oppression on our communities, our careers, and our identities.
- Move beyond thinking about individual, overt prejudice to thinking about larger systems of institutional oppression and privilege.
