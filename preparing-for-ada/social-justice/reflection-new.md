| Term | Definition |

| Privilege | * I have quite a lot of privilege in our society. My grandparents on both sides raised their children in an 'intact' household, they instilled a love of learning and history that is a core part of my identity. Three out of four of my grandparents are white, and while 'diversity' (racial, education level, socio-economic status, gender-diversity) was acceptable, and spoken of as a positive, the understanding was that 'we' were above that. 'We' should not be like 'them,' then we could avoid the inherent taint of 'other.' I never understood how this was supposed to work; either you fully except others, or you don't. Full stop. Thanks to this dissonance, and a million other factors, I learned early on to keep my confusion, opinions, insights, and rage to myself. I learned that being white and quiet has it's own privileges: people assume my whiteness, they assume I share a narrative similar to theirs, similar enough to share their opinions. My quietness and whiteness allows me to see people's ignorance, and their prejudices.  It gave me a safe, quiet corner from which I can observe and try to understand their opinions, behaviors, and intentions as well as their fears and assumptions. |
| Oppression | The socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals. Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one’s membership in targeted social identity groups. * Intersectionality has given me a new way to talk about, to explain (parse) oppression and its effects. |
| Ally | Person of a dominant or privileged racial, gender, sexual or other identity who supports and seeks to further the causes of those who lack such privilege (such as people of color or LGBT people). * Thinking of myself as a potential Ally (instead of a single person, speaking out alone) has allowed me to use my own privileges and observations to be more comfortable and confident about speaking up and speaking out.|
| Intersectionality | The interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage. * People feel comfortable with broad strokes, they can understand (admit) that a rich white man has more privilege than a poor white woman. But when you bring it down to the details; how the benefits of privilege can stack up the same as the detriments of disadvantage can pile up, people get uncomfortable. Intersectionality is a beautiful framework for discussing these sticky details that far too many people reject due to it's stickiness (uncomfortableness)|
| Institutional Racism | Patterns of social institutions — such as governmental organizations, schools, banks, and courts of law — giving biased treatment to a group of people based on their race. * Growing up in Flint, I definately had an awareness of this, though I was never able to articulate it when faced with people that didn't believe/understand/comprehend. Watching (after reading Ada's various links) Dorothy Roberts Ted talk on race-based medicine, in my 3rd year working inside the healthcare system, was beyond eye-opening, beyond anything. I think I was stuck here, in this tightening vise of cognitive dissonance, until quite recently. I didn't fully understand why I was so bothered: I no longer felt comfortable simply understanding, I was ready to share. Ready to speak out, to speak up... but my job, my chosen career, my livelihood, depended on my ability to concurrently accept and work with a system I now undertood to be fundamentally flawed: yes intentions matter, yes most of the people I work with are great individuals, but a system that ignores it's own culpability in and continued support of basic societal disparities is a broken system. Statistics 101: garbage in, garbage out. The system is flawed (garbage out) because it's most basic assumptions are flawed (garbage in).|
| Queer | An umbrella term sometimes used by LGBTQA people to refer to the entire LGBT community. The inclusivity of this term can help build community without demanding that individuals choose and represent a specific identity. * I guess I didn't see/get the second sentence of this until now. But I've found that my comprehension often works that way. Now that I better understand (from real-world encounters), how the choices surrounding identify that are too often forced on us from outside, I am glad whenever I notice a safe space/word that indicates 'welcome' no matter where you might find yourself. |
| Transgender | This term has many definitions. It is frequently used as an umbrella term to refer to all people who do not identify with their assigned gender at birth or the binary gender system. Most often we use it to refer to someone whose gender differs from the biological sex to which they were assigned at birth. Transgender people may identify as male or female, or they may feel that neither label fits them. * Transgender. This is one that I can say I found a bias in myself. I was aware of my personal uncomfortableness, but not how I allowed that feeling to keep my own mind (and heart) closed to the same empathy and acceptance that I prided myself on giving to others. I could recognize the hypocrisy in my mother, when her own prejudices came bubbling out in rage. But not in myself when I failed to speak up. Not in myself when I failed to listen. Now that I've seen my own bias ... well, I'm still flawed. But I'm listening now.|
| Non-Binary | This term has some overlap with the term transgender, and there are many people who use both. A non-binary person feels that their gender does fit within the binary understanding of male of female. Non-binary people may choose to use gender neutral pronouns like they/them or or ze/zir [pdf on preferred pronouns](https://www.ccsu.edu/lgbt/files/PreferredGenderPronounsForFaculty.pdf).  *Thanks to some physical traits in my family, I've seen up close some of the impact that can be caused by the mismatch between what society thinks you should look/act/be like and your personal physical reality. My mother identifies as a white, cis gender female. She has, in various instinces throghout her life, been seen by others as black/brown, gay, transgender: other. She is six-foot two inches tall, not feminine (my younger sister also has a very 'ambiguous' appearance, though she is far more comfortable with it), with a complection that ranges from olive to brown, and hair that has been considered 'ethnic' in appearance. She hated every time her gender or sexuality was questioned, though she seemed to revel in the racial assumptions. When my self-professed 'hippy' (i.e. open, understanding, liberal) mother started railing against gay marriage I saw how her experiences were coloring her opinions and how detrimental it was to her ability to understand others.|
| Cisgender | Types of gender identity where an individual's experience of their own gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth. * The ultimate basis for identity in our society. Binary. One or the other. The assumption in our society is that if you are anything else you must be broken.|
| Implicit Bias | Unlike explicit bias (which reflects the attitudes or beliefs that one endorses at a conscious level), implicit bias is the bias in judgment and/or behavior that results from subtle cognitive processes (e.g., implicit attitudes and implicit stereotypes) that often operate at a level below conscious awareness and without intentional control. * This is the 'knee-jerk' reactions. The racist/homophobic/dividing responses that we assume are 'right' simply because we feel right. That gut-level response is important for many things, but it is colored by too many variables. We must learn to quiet our reactions to help us better understand and question our own flawed assumptions and reactions.|
| Microaggression | Everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership. * This is why I learned to listen. Listening let me hear and see these behaviors without having to directly feel their sting. It is so very good to now have the language to talk about this.|
