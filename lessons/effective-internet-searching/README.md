# Effective Internet Searching
_Jump start: Lesson 3_

## Learning Goals
- To know where to go for answers
- To be able to evaluate a source as likely to have the answer you are looking for (or not)
- To be able to narrow your search results to yield better results
- To find answers to a question on your own

## Overview
The sheer breadth and depth of the field of computer science means that no one programmer is going to have all the answers. The good thing is that software developers tend to collect all their knowledge together. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a place where software developers ask questions and give answers. But mostly importantly, software developers learn how to search effectively on Google. They know what's most important is that they can find the answer, not that they know the answer right away.

## Techniques to try
