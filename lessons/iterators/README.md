_Jump start: Lesson 11_

## Learning Goals
- Vocabulary: blocks, loops, iterator, iteration, iteration variable, counter-controlled, sentinel-controlled, loop table, times loop, range, while loop
- To know the purpose for iteration in creating programs
- To write loops in order to prevent code duplication and repetition
- To understand how a loop will execute the statements inside and what the resulting output will be

# Blocks
Blocks (also referred to as _closures_, especially in other languages like JavaScript) are not a unique features of Ruby, but they're one that many people talk about (and more people use without realizing it!) What is a block?

>A section of code which is grouped together.

Zzzzz....

A block is a piece of code that _is not executed immediately_. Instead, it is stored in a variable or passed to a method as a parameter to be potentially executed at a later time.

Sound complicated? Let's look at some Ruby.

```ruby
[1,2,3,4].each do |number|
  puts number * 100 # <= this is a block. :)
end

[1,2,3,4].each { |number|
  puts number * 100 # <= this is a block too! :D
}
```

`number * 100` is a chunk of code, similar to what would be in a method, but in this case we don't need to go through all the trouble of creating a method just to iterate over some numbers.

Block can be identified by either `do ... end` or `{ }`.

Block arguments are defined using a pair of `|` (pipe) characters. They look like a slide, so I like to say that we slide arguments into the block. For example:

```
[1,2,3].each do |number|
  puts number # wheeeee! Right down the slide!
end
```

`number` is the _block argument_, this means that objects given to the block are going to be assigned to the `number` variable within the scope of the block. When the code in the block finishes execution, the block arguments are destroyed.

# Notes: Each Iterator

## Each
The each iterator is used on a collection of data, like an Array, Hash or Range. This iterator will iterate over each element of the collection, one by one, and provide access to each element using the _iteration variable_. The each iterator will continue to execute until it has reached the end of the collection.

The `each` iterator is comprised of three pieces:
1. The collection to be iterated
2. The _iteration variable_ to store each value
3. The block of code to be executed in the iteration

In the example below, this iterator will iterate over the `veggies` array. For each iteration, the `vegetable` variable will be assigned to the value of the next element in the array, starting with the first. The block of code will be executed for each `vegetable` variable, which will print out the name of the vegetable.

```ruby
# A list of veggies
veggies = ["carrot", "yam", "zucchini", "spinach"]

veggies.each do |vegetable|
  puts "a vegetable: #{vegetable}"
end
```
output:
```
a vegetable: carrot
a vegetable: yam
a vegetable: zucchini
a vegetable: spinach
```

In the example below, this iterator will iterate over the `names` array. For each iteration, the `name` variable will be assigned to the value of the next element in the array, starting with the first. The block of code will be executed for each name, which will say hello to each person!

```ruby
# A list of names
names = ["Rey", "Finn", "Han"]

names.each do |name|
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
```
output:
```
Hello Rey!
Hello Finn!
Hello Han!
```

# Notes: Introduction to Loops
Loops are programming constructs that help you repeat a code action an arbitrary number of times without copying and pasting the code. Another term for a **loop** is **iteration**. All high-level programming languages provide various forms of loops, which can be used to execute one or more statements repeatedly.

For example, if we wanted to print out "hello" five hundred times, we could write:
```ruby
puts "hello! "
puts "hello! "
puts "hello! "
puts "hello! "
puts "hello! "
# ... 495 more times
```

Using a loop, we could re-write this as:
```ruby
500.times do
  puts "hello! "
end
```

There are 2 categories of loops:  **counter-controlled** and **sentinel-controlled** loops

**Counter-controlled** loops are used when the number of loops can be determined prior to loop execution.  For example, a copying machine copies a paper a set number of times, and we know exactly how many times the copier will copy the paper.

**Sentinel-controlled** loops are used when the number of loops cannot be determined prior to loop execution.  For example, if you do jumping jacks until you get tired, it is uncertain how many jumping jacks you will do before stopping.

**There are four types of loops in Ruby that we will start with: `times`, `range-each`, `while`, and `until`.**

## Times
You use the `times` iterator to run a block of code `N` times.

You can use a `times` loops with or without an _iteration variable_. This variable is denoted between the vertical bars (pipe character) `|` and is used to store data associated with the iteration.

In the example below, `N` is equal to three. This example _does not_ use an iteration variable.
```ruby
3.times do
  puts "hello! "
end
```
output:
```
hello!
hello!
hello!
```

In the example below, `N` is equal to two. This example _does_ use an iteration variable, `i`, which will correspond to value of the iteration.
```ruby
2.times do |i|
  puts i # wheeee remember the slide?
end
```
output:
```
0
1
```

## Ranges
The main use of ranges is to express a sequence. Sequences have a start point, an end point, and a way to produce successive values in the sequence.

Ruby creates these sequences using the `..` and `...` range operators. The two-dot form creates an _inclusive_ range, while the three-dot form creates a range that _excludes_ the specified high value. The `each` loop using a range uses an _iteration variable_ (again passed to the _block_ between `|` characters), `num` in this example.

```ruby
# Inclusive range example
# note the ..
(5..9).each do |num|
  puts num
end

# output
5
6
7
8
9
```

```ruby
# Exclusive range example
# note the ...
(5...9).each do |num|
  puts num
end

# output
5
6
7
8
```

## While Loops
The `while` loop is useful when you want to continue doing an action while a certain condition is `true` but you may not know how many times you'll need to complete that action. It is an example of a _sentinel-controlled loop_. As soon as the condition stops being true, the loop will terminate.

```ruby
i = 0

while i < 4
  puts i
  i += 1
end
```

The above code will output the values of i until i is no longer less than 4, resulting in the following output:

```
0
1
2
3
```
![while loop](../images/while-loop.png)

You can read the condition and execute of the `while` loop as _while condition is **true** do..._

A while loop example:  This loop repeats while the user enters "yes".
```ruby
again = "yes"

while again == "yes"
  puts "Let's play a game!"
  puts "..."
  puts "Would you like to play again? (yes/no) > "
  again = gets.chomp
end
```


## Until Loops
The `until` loop acts as an inverse of the `while` loop. The loop will execute _until_ the condition evaluates as `true`.


```ruby
i = 0

until i == 4
   puts i
   i += 1
end
```

The above code will output the values of i until i is equal to 4, resulting in the following (equivalent to the `while` loop) output:
```
0
1
2
3
```
![until loop](../images/until-loop.png)


You can read the condition and execute of the `until` loop as _until condition is **true** do..._

An until loop example: This loop will repeat until the user guesses the number 6.

```ruby
number = 0

until number == 6
  puts "Guess my number (1-10) > "
  number = gets.chomp.to_i
end

puts "You guessed it!"
```
