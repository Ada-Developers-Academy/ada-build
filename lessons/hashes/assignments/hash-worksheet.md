# Hash Worksheet

Read the code in each section, then write exactly what the code prints out.

Each problem stands alone. Variables from previous problems do not exist.

*Example:*
```ruby
x = 5
y = 6
print(x+y)
# => 11
```
## Problem Set

1.
```ruby
person = {
  "first_name" => "ada",
  "last_name" => "lovelace",

puts person.length
puts person["last_name"]
```

2.
```ruby
animals = {
  "dog" => "canine",
  "cat" => "feline"
}

animals["cat"] = "feline"
puts animals["dog"]

```

3.
```ruby
chuck_norris = {
  "punch" => 99,
  "kick" => 98,
  "stops_bullets_with_hands" => false
}

chuck_norris["kick"] = 25

```

4.
```ruby
