# Programming Grammar
_Jump start: Lesson 9_

## Learning Goals
* Understand different data types (string, integer, float)
* Be able to use variables
* Be able to print 
* Understand and be able to use strings, string concatenation, and string interpolation
* Be able to read input from the user
* Practice writing and debugging Ruby code

## Activities
* Review [notes](./notes.md) on comments types, operators, variables, assignment statements, strings, and string operations
* Watch [Video: Values, Variables, Commands and Comments](https://vimeo.com/channels/1001988)
* Complete the [practice problems] and then check your answers using `irb`
* Write a madlibs program
  * First play a few on [eduplace](https://www.eduplace.com/tales/) to become familiar with the game
  * Create a MadLib program that accepts input from the user and outputs a completed MadLib
  * Use up to ten different parts of speech in order to fill in your MadLib
  * Output should consist of a paragraph of output that has the user’s input substituted into the MadLib, we have provided an example run, but your madlib program should be unique to you

    ```ruby
    Welcome to my MadLib program. Please enter in some information below:

    name: Starr
    adjective: huge
    noun: tablecloth
    adjective: dry
    food (plural): tacos
    noun (plural): packs
    verb ending in -ed: ended
    noun: jellyfish

    HERE'S YOUR MADLIB.......

    Come on over to Starr’s Pizza Parlor where you can enjoy your favorite huge-dish pizza`s.
    You can try our famous tablecloth-lovers pizza,
    or select from our list of dry toppings,
    including delicious tacos, packs, and many more.
    Our crusts are hand-ended and basted in jellyfish to make
    them seem more Hand-made.
    ```

  * Your code should use comments throughout to explain the code, reuse at least one word, and as for at lease 1 number
  * [Optional] Explore Ruby's built in methods for [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html) like `capitalize`, `downcase`, `upcase`
