# Bio & Resume

Another piece of pre-ada work is preparing a short biographical introduction (1-2 paragraphs) and a resume illustrating work and educational experience.  This information is shared with our company partners for internships.  It provides them a bit more information about you prior to interviews.  They are not shared further by Ada.

## Bio

In the bio you will create a gist markdown document with the filename `YOUR-NAME-Bio.md` and submit a link to that document along with the rest of the Pre-Ada Homework.

We have prepared an [example bio](example-bio.md) for you to use as a reference.  You can click on the `raw` button to see how it was formatted.

## Resume

Please also submit a short resume with your recent work history and educational background.  We also have an [example resume](example-resume.md) for you to use as an example.
