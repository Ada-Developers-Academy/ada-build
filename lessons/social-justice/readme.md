# Introduction to Social Justice
_Jump start: Lesson 0_

In this lesson you’ll be asked to read and think about issues of identity, privilege, oppression, and social justice. This may be new to you, or it may be a huge piece of your daily, lived experience. Our goal here is to build some of the linguistic and conceptual skills that will start the work of having safe, productive, community-affirming conversations about systemic inequities.

## Learning goals
- Develop an increased understanding of the impact of privilege and oppression on our communities, our careers, and our identities.
- Move beyond thinking about individual, overt prejudice to thinking about larger systems of institutional oppression and privilege.
- Develop a shared social justice vocabulary.


## Ada's statement of inclusivity
Students, staff, volunteers, TA's, and reps from our sponsor companies come to Ada Developers Academy with an incredible diversity of identity and experience. We strive to make Ada an inclusive, safe, and equitable space for every member of our community. We recognize and celebrate difference along many axes including, but not limited to, sexual orientation, gender identity and presentation, age, race, ethnicity, class, religion, physical appearance, ability, national origin, educational background, and parental status. Our community includes women and gender diverse people (people who identify as trans, non-binary, gender queer, gender fluid, and gender non-conforming).

## Reflection
Note: If you have been accepted into Ada you should email your reflection directly to Sarah Ervin, Ada's Student Counselor and Diversity Trainer.

Take some time to reflect on the readings. This reflection can take on whatever form works best for you, you might want to have conversations with people about what you read, spend some time free form writing, create a video sharing what you learned or maybe produce a piece of art. It is totally up to you and what works best for you. 

### Reflection questions
We are including a few reflection questions which you can use as a guide if you are having trouble getting started. You can address all of our prompts, choose only a few, or come up with your own.

* What, if anything, was new to you here? What additional questions does this raise for you?

* After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?

* Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?
