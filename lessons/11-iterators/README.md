# Loops and Iterators

## Learning Goals
- Vocabulary: blocks, loops, iterator, iteration, iteration variable, counter-controlled, sentinel-controlled, loop table, times loop, range, while loop
- To know the purpose for iteration in creating programs
- To write loops in order to prevent code duplication and repetition
- To understand how a loop will execute the statements inside and what the resulting output will be
