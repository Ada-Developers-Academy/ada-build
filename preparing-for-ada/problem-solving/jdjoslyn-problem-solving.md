# Problem Solving
_Jump start: Lesson 2_

## Learning Goals
* Understand what an algorithm is
  -  An algorithms is a set of steps, or rules, with five basic properties, finiteness, definiteness, inputs, outputs, and effectiveness.
* Develop your own algorithm for a task, test, refine, and evaluate it
  - I chose the paper snowflake activity.
  - I tested it with a nine year old child.
  - She was able to create a snowflake from my instructions.
  - part about cutting into thirds could use a little tweaking for visual clarity.
  - otherwise I think it is good.

## Activities
Start by reading through our notes on [algorithms](./algorithms.md).

Write an algorithm for getting to the house of a family member or friend. Make sure to include all 5 essential elements of an algorithm: input, output, finiteness, definiteness, and effectiveness.

1. Decide to go to friends apartment.
1. Get yourself ready to go.
1. Unlock your front door.
1. Open your front door.
1. Step through your front door.
1. Lock and close your front door.
1. Follow the sidewalk until it forks.
1. Follow the path on the right around the apartments until you get to the first fork.
1. Turn right at this fork.
1. Walk forward until you get to the door that directly faces the sidewalk.
1. Knock firmly on that door.
1. If friend answers door, you are done.
1. If someone else answers door, briefly greet them and then return home.
1. If no one answers the door, return home.

### Make a Paper Snowflake

  1. Get a single piece of standard (8*11) printer paper.
  1. Get any functioning pair of scissors.
  1. Place them both on a clear flat surface in front of you.
  1. Hold the top right corner of the paper and fold it towards the lower left side.
  1. Bring it down until the paper forms into a right-angled triangle.
  1. Ensure that all the edges match up and touch each other exactly.
  1. There should be a small rectangular section left at the bottom.
  1. Pick up the scissors and hold them scissors in your dominant hand.
  1. Pick up the paper and hold it in your other hand.
  1. Now you can cut the small rectangular section off using the scissors.
  1. Put the scissors and larger paper back down.
  1. Discard the small rectangular paper you cut off.
  1. You should now have a large triangle that unfolds to a square shape.
  1. Fold the square paper in half diagonally to make a triangle again.
  1. Now, fold the triangle in half another time so the long ends meet.
  1. Fold this triangle in half twice more.
  1. Pick up the scissors again and hold them in your dominant hand.
  1. Hold the folded paper in your other hand.
  1. You should now have a small folded triangle.
  1. Cut small pieces off all three corners and discard the pieces.
  1. Cut out small half circles from each side, turning the paper and scissors as needed.
  1. Set the scissors back down.
  1. Discard the cut pieces, retaining only the initial triangle paper.
  1. Gently unfold it.
  1. You now have a paper snowflake.
