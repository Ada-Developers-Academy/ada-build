## Programming Strategies

As you learn how to program, remember that you are learning a new language. There will be lots of new vocabulary in addition to the new concepts. The breadth and depth of the Computer Science field means that you should be learning every day that you are in the field. Learning how to learn is therefore one of the fundamental secrets to becoming a successful software developer. You need to understand how you process information best and how to tackle big (and small) problems.

For people that have been away from the classroom or learning for awhile, this can be a daunting task. As you work through this curriculum, you should try different strategies for absorbing the material and figure out what ways work best for you.

### Learning to code strategies

#### Before the lesson
* Pre-Read the notes, and optionally highlight the pieces that you anticipate will be most challenging for you to absorb
* Write or review the learning goal for the lesson

#### During the lesson
* Keep a vocabulary sheet where you write down relevant new vocabulary and definitions in your own words.

#### After the lesson
* Post-Read the notes, and optionally highlight the parts that were challenging to understand and make yourself notes with further explanations or examples
* Write down the main points of the lesson
* Explain in simple terms the main points of the lesson to someone else
* Write out example code of your own using the same concepts
* Find other example code online and then write comments of your own explaining what is happening
* Try small exercise drills that reinforce the concept is a small bite-size way

#### General strategies
* After you've moved forward in your learning, go back and redo an old assignment from scratch or re-factor old code.
* Start by typing in code that you already know works. Make small, incremental changes to the code, predicting the output/change and then verifying if that assumption was correct.
* Ask someone else to walk you through their code without your computer in front of you. Listen attentively and ask questions. Only after you are finished listening and understanding, go back to your computer and utilize what you learned from them.
* Become a questioner. Engage yourself in lectures and discussions by asking questions. 
* Utilize online discussion forums and your peers as necessary.
* Look for interconnections. The content in every lesson is part of a SYSTEM of interconnected ideas, not a random list of things to memorize. Always relating new learning to previous learning.
