# macOS Keyboard navigation

_JumpStart: Lesson 4_

_Note: You can postpone this lesson until you have a Mac computer_

## Learning Goals

* Become familiar with navigating the macOS environment
* Understand why and how to utilize multiple tabs, application windows, and desktops
* Start using application shortcuts and hotkeys
* Effectively find applications, folders, and files
* Effectively manage open applications

## Overview

Most software developers rely heavily on their keyboards and less so on their pointing devices (e.g., mouse, trackpad). This lesson will help you get comfortable using your keyboard to navigate in macOS.

## Common macOS shortcuts

Fill in the table below with the matching macOS shortcuts, if you don't know them use an internet search to find them.

| What the command does           | Mac shortcut |
| :------------------------------ | :----------- |
| Copy                            |              |
| Paste                           |              |

| Dock                | The Dock is the strip of apps at the bottom of the screen. You can change its size and location by going to Preference > Dock.

| Finder              | Finder is an application that lets you visually navigate your files and folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Menu bar            | The Menu bar at the top of macOS is context sensitive, and will change based on the application you have in focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Mission control     | Allows you to see all your open apps at once, there are many ways to launch this application, search the internet for the one that works best for you.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Mouse & Trackpad    | Spend some time in your system preferences customizing these to your work style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
## Learning the Menu Symbols

Whenever you open a menu, it will use these symbols to show you which keyboard shortcuts you can use to run the menu option at hand. It can be quite helpful to make a set of flashcards to remember these. I thought they were really _weird_ at first, and flashcards were a quick and easy method for me to test whether I'd learned the symbols correctly.

| --------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command   |     ⌘      | Ah, here's where I left those four robots I can command to open menus / do other computer stuff for me. |
| Option    |     ⌥      | Sliding down a bookcase lined with options & picking the first one that looks good.                     |
| Control   |     ⌃      | The magic button I need to press to gain control of a robot.                                            |
| Shift     |     ⇧      | Hey, you short lowercase letter, come up here!                                                          |
| Caps Lock |     ⇪      | And stay up! Here's a box to help. You can stand on it. :)                                              |

## A Word About Mice

Steve Jobs had a [weird thing](http://www.cultofmac.com/269222/steve-jobs-hated-idea-multi-button-mouse-designer-claims/) about single-button mice. Right-click is disabled on macs by default, but you can turn it on via the following steps:

1. Use spotlight to open up `System Preferences`
1. Click on `Trackpad`
1. Click on the `Point and Click` tab
1. Check the box next to `Secondary click`

You can also [two-finger click](https://www.howtogeek.com/218715/how-to-right-click-with-two-fingers-and-other-os-x-trackpad-gestures/) or [ctrl-click](https://www.wikihow.com/Right-Click-on-a-Mac). 

## Practice tasks

Try to perform these tasks on the Mac, to learn how to navigate the operating system.

1. Use Spotlight to open the finder
    * What does tab do in finder?
    * What does shift + tab do in finder?
1. Do the following commands using only the keyboard:
    1. Open your web browser
    1. Navigate to adadevelopersacademy.org
    1. Keeping the Ada browser tab open, open a new tab
    1. Navigate to google.com
    1. Navigate back to the Ada tab
    1. Refresh the web page
    1. Quit out of the web browser (don't just close the tabs, close the whole application)
1. Use Spotlight to open Finder, web browser, system preferences and then switch between all three applications

## Split Screen

When you write code on a laptop, it is often important to be able to see documentation and code side-by-side. The latest version of Mac OS allows you to do this without any additional apps. Apps like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) will give you even more control over this, if desired.

![Terminal & VS Code Side-by-side](images/terminal-vs-code.png)

1. Click and hold on the green maximize icon in the upper left corner of an app until it responds (by shrinking)
1. Drag the window to one side of your screen
1. Choose the second app from your open apps to display on the other side of the screen

There are a number of other ways to accomplish this same behavior, so be sure to play around with this. **It will be necessary**, so if it's challenging now, just keep practicing!

## Taking Screenshots

As of macOS Mojave there is a handy Screenshot.app that you can run in your Applications folder.  (It's inside Utilities.)  

### Screenshot Keyboard Shotcuts

Screenshots on a Mac are very cool. By default, they save a file to the desktop. If you add Control (⌃) to the shortcut, the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard instead.
