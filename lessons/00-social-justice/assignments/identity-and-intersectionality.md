# Identity and Intersectionality
_Lesson 00 Social Justice_

## Overview
In this section, we're going to think critically about the myriad parts of our own identities. Next, we'll contexualize this work with the core concept of Intersectionality. Lastly, we'll read three articles that highlight the importance of intersectionality in effectively addressing diversity in tech.

Our identities are complicated. We carry with us many different affinities, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized. We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.
