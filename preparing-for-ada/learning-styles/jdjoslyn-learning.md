##### New Learning
Multimodal. I am so glad I took this test. Not only did it help me finally undersand my own learning style (something that has always been frustratingly ellusive). It is giving me the framework to learn better ... my way :)

My way has never made sense. My way was always backwards. My way was always wrong.

Now I see that it was never wrong. I wasn't broken or stupid.

Now I have the tools to harness my love of learning, my intellect, my passions.

I have the tools to use my innate gifts, to build on my experiences and my learning.

Instead of trying to put myself in a box I was never meant for, now I see _how_ I can (and have) utilize(d) all the learning strategies to fit the situation.

I know now that if one strategy isn't working, it doesn't mean I'm stupid or can't learn that subject. It is just a mismatch and it simply means I should try a different track.

###### _original_

I've learned a lot about myself over the years. The last two have been especially enlightening.

These learning style questions always made me crazy. I never felt that they were helpful at all or gave me any insight because the results seem so general to me.

Now though, I understand that these results are showing my adaptability and it has helped me realize that I can (and do) use different  (and even multiple) techniques all the time to learn various things. These results have now helped me to, in a way, make my fluid learning styles quantifiable ==> and therefore manageable!
